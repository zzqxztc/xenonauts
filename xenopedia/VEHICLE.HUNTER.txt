<desc>The &quot;Hunter&quot; Scout Car is a small armoured vehicle that is used for scouting and fire support during combat missions. It fills the space of two soldiers in the dropship, but is tougher, can move faster and has a longer sight range than a soldier.&#10;&#10;The Hunter is derived from the Daimler Ferret armoured car, a vehicle small and light enough to be carried inside one of our Charlie dropships (though there is only space for one vehicle in a strike team). The &quot;scout car&quot; designation is instructive; the Hunter is not a battle tank. Any vehicle light enough to be carried inside a helicopter will have relatively flimsy armour and the Hunter is no exception to this. Nevertheless, it is far quicker to replace a few damaged armour plates after a mission than it is to nurse a wounded soldier back to health, making this vehicle an extremely effective way to scout the battlefield in the hands of a careful commander.&#10;&#10;The Hunter is equipped with dual .30cal machineguns, which are powerful but inaccurate. They are better suited to suppressing our foes than slaying them, making the Hunter a useful infantry support vehicle. If you would like to upgrade its firepower, your engineers believe they could refit the turret with powerful explosive rockets instead - however, these are hardly likely to leave much behind for my team to study.&#10;&#10;The Hunter is available for construction in our workshop. Remind the louts to follow my blueprints to the letter; they would be working in the laboratories if they actually knew anything about the design process.</desc>
<cdesc>&quot;猎手装甲车&quot;是一种小型的装甲车，可以用来执行侦察任务，或者在战斗中提供火力支援。在运输机内占用两名战士的空间，但是相比战士而言，它更加强悍，移动迅速，视野范围也更广。&#10;&#10;猎手的灵感来源于戴姆勒雪豹装甲车，一种轻小型装甲车，可以用查理运输机运输（虽然每个攻击小队的空间只够装备一台）。&quot;侦察车&quot;的称号顾名思义。猎手不是作战坦克。所有的轻型装甲车都会让人联想到薄薄的装甲片，猎手也不例外。但是，它能迅速更换损坏的护甲，比战士受伤之后的恢复要快。在小心谨慎的指挥官手中，猎手是一种极高效的侦察工具。&#10;&#10;猎手装备了.30口径双重火力机关枪，火力强大但是精准度不高。通常用于火力压制而不是歼灭任务，适合作为步兵的支援载具。如果你想要提高它的火力的话，你的工程师一定可以将它的机关枪改装成强大的爆炸火箭弹——但是需要我的团队去进行研究。&#10;&#10;猎手可以在车间中施工建造。提醒那些笨蛋一定按照我蓝图上说的来，要是他们知道点设计原理的话，早就在实验室工作了。</cdesc>
