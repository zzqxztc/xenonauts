<desc>The alien Plasma Cannon is a large infantry weapon that measures a little less than fifty inches in length. We believe it is best thought of as the alien equivalent of a bazooka or rocket-propelled grenade, firing a single powerful bolt of plasma that has great range and will inflict major damage on anything caught in the blast radius.&#10;&#10;It is vastly superior to its conventional counterparts. The most obvious advantage is the increased damage it inflicts: at short range it can penetrate at least 15 inches of solid steel (precise measurements were difficult as we ran out of steel before the projectile ran out of power). In basic terms, it is enough to destroy virtually any conventional vehicle in the world in a single shot. Also important is the ammunition capacity of the weapon - it takes even a skilled operator up to ten seconds to reload a traditional anti-tank weapon after every shot, while the alien Plasma Cannon can draw four shots from its battery before it must be changed. The weapon also suffers minimal recoil and has no back-blast, making it easier to handle and safer for adjacent friendly units.&#10;&#10;Thankfully, alien materials are far more resistant against the penetrative effect of these projectiles than conventional materials. We believe the vaporised metal forms a shell around the projectile when it strikes steel, doing much of the penetrating work for it. However, the higher melting point of alien alloys prevents this from occurring and instead the projectile must rely on raw energy to inflict damage. Our more advanced technology gives us some protection against this weapon - though the Wolf and Buzzard are not strong enough to protect a soldier from a direct hit, the Wolf in particular should help our troops survive being caught in the blast. I have already warned your men about the fearsome power of this weapon; one hopes it will encourage them to get out of the way of the projectiles. </desc>
<cdesc>外星等离子加农炮是一种长约50英寸的大型单兵武器。我们可以认为这种武器是火箭筒或榴弹发射器的外星版本，它每次能够发射一枚强有力的等离子体炮弹，具有相当远的射程，并能够对爆炸半径内的所有物体造成严重伤害。&#10;&#10;等离子加农炮比传统的类似武器先进的多。一个显而易见的进步在于其威力的提升：近距离射击时，它能够穿透至少15英寸厚的脱氧钢板（精确测量这一数值很苦难，因为在它的炮弹威力完全消退之前，我们最厚的脱氧钢板就已经被穿透了）。一般条件下，它能够仅用一发炮弹就摧毁世界上任何传统载具。等离子加农炮的另一个重要进步是它的弹夹容量 - 即便是一个熟练的操作员，也需要10秒钟的时间来为传统反坦克武器重新填装弹药。然而等离子加农炮在重新充能前，可以仅依靠电池连续发射四发炮弹。等离子加农炮几乎没有任何后坐力，这使得其更加容易使用，对附近的友方单位来说也更加安全。&#10;&#10;谢天谢地，与传统材料相比，外星材料能够更好地抵抗等离子炮弹的穿透力。我们认为当等离子炮弹接触到普通金属时，汽化的金属会在等离子炮弹周围形成一个保护层，这层保护层提供了大部分穿透力。然而，外星合金的高熔点使得这种现象很难发生。等离子炮弹必须仅仅依靠自身的能量来破坏外星合金。一种更加先进的技术可以帮助我们对抗这种武器 - 虽然野狼战斗护甲和秃鹰跳跃服都不能够在直接命中的条件下保护我们的士兵，但是野狼战斗服能够使我们的士兵在爆炸冲击波中存活下来。我已经警告过你的士兵们，这种武器十分危险。希望这能够使得他们尽量躲开等离子炮弹的行进路径。</cdesc>
