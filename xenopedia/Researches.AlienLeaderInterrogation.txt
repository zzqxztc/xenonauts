<desc>Our enemies are members of a vast stellar empire that spans several galaxies and hundreds of planets; this invasion fleet is only a tiny fraction of their military might (although considered more than enough to deal with us). This empire has existed for millennia, linked by ships that can travel interstellar distances in days. With no rivals to define itself against, it seemingly has no name. They believe no other interstellar civilisation exists, or ever has.&#10;&#10;This empire is ruled by a caste of living god-creatures known as the Praetors. While the lesser creatures are clones that follow orders unquestioningly, these Praetors seem distinct individuals locked in an endless struggle with one another for power and influence. Low-ranking praetors are apparently present on the largest alien craft / bases, overseeing the work of their underlings directly. These creatures will surely know the true reason why the extraterrestrials have travelled to our planet, the real reasons behind the invasion. We must capture one alive, whatever the cost may be.&#10;&#10;I have little doubt the task will be difficult. During the questioning of our captive, I could not help but notice the interrogation team becoming steadily less adversarial - indeed, after six hours, they had almost become friendly. Alarmed, I called a halt to the experiment and had the captive terminated. It emerged that one of my scientists had slipped into a trance during the interrogation and surreptitiously begun building a bomb large enough to blow up half the facility. Given a few more hours, he might well have finished the job. Dark days, Commander: it appears these creatures are capable of manipulating our very minds.</desc>
<cdesc>我们的敌人来自一个毁灭了数以万计星系和行星的恒星。这次侵略的舰队只是他们雄厚军事力量的一小部分罢了（然后敌方认为这只舰队对付我们已经绰绰有余了）。这个外星帝国已经在宇宙中存在了上千年，拥有可以在几天内横穿星际的飞船。似乎从来没遇到过对手，这个帝国没有名字。帝国的居民都深信除他们之外，没有其他星系文明存在，或者说从来没有存在过。&#10;&#10;帝国是由一个都是金色生物的阶级统治的，称之为“Praetors”-地方官。当只是机械遵从命令的克隆体外星士兵数量越来越少时，这些地方官也就变得越来越争权夺势，整个阶级勾心斗角的趋势愈演愈烈。等级低的地方官一般都呆在最大的外星飞船或基地中，直接监督他们手下的士兵。这些外星人很清楚的知道在入侵地球背后的的真正原因。因此无论代价多大，我们必须活捉一个地方官回来。&#10;&#10;我认为这个任务应该是比较艰巨的。在审讯小组审讯俘虏的时候，我只能眼睁睁地看着他们和俘虏之间关系变得不那么敌对。事实上，6个小时的审讯过后，他们之间几乎变成非常友好了。我警觉起来，于是终止了这场实验并且把那个俘虏处决了。期间我带领的小队的一名科学家在审讯的过程中出现了精神恍惚的状况，并且背地里偷偷地在制造一个足以炸掉半个实验室的炸弹。如果再晚发现几个小时，他应该已经完成炸弹并且引爆了。这是黑暗的日子，但是长官：外星人应该是具有蛊惑人心的能力的。</cdesc>
