<desc>The average alien soldier is just an empty shell, possessing an instinctive knowledge of the craft of war but little higher brain function. There is a reason for this: alien Officers are highly intelligent, and do not lead their troops in battle so much as directly possess them. I would suggest that the word &quot;Officer&quot; is a misnomer; &quot;Controller&quot; would be more appropriate.&#10;&#10;The alien mindset is strange. We were already aware the same species and rank were identical clones, but it seems that these creatures actually consider themselves interchangeable. Not exactly a collective consciousness, more that they simply have no concept of &quot;self&quot;. Provided one of their clones survives, they would not consider themselves to be dead. This makes interrogation a struggle - not only is it difficult to threaten a creature which cannot grasp the concept of its own death, choosing the correct pronoun when asking a question becomes a minefield. Nonetheless, we managed to glean a little useful information: the captive confirmed the intention of the invasion was to kill humans individually, but not collectively. It seems they are not actually trying to wipe us out. &#10;&#10;In truth, this is nothing we did not already know. If the aliens wanted to annihilate us, they could simply have bombed us into extinction from orbit. The invasion evidently has a higher purpose, but we could not extract it from our captive. We will have to capture an alien Leader to learn more.</desc>
<cdesc>普通的外星士兵基本上都是些傀儡，依靠本能来进行战斗，其大脑缺乏更高级的功能。造成这种现象的原因之一是：外星指挥官具有极高的智力，并且会在战斗中指挥他们的部队，甚至于直接接管他们的行为。这样看来，&quot;指挥官&quot;的称呼并不恰当，应该称他们为&quot;控制者&quot;。&#10;&#10;外星人的精神抵抗力非常强。我们已经知道，同一种类同一阶层的外星人都是同一个个体的克隆。这些外星人实际上也认为它们之间都是可以互相替换的。这并非是一般的集体意识，在这些外星人的认知中根本就没有&quot;我&quot;的概念。只要它们中任意一个克隆体还活着，其他个体就都不会认为自己会死亡。这使得对外星人的审讯非常困难 - 不仅仅在于威胁一个没有自身死亡概念的生物非常困难，在审讯问题中选择合适的代词也让人头痛。尽管如此，我们还是收集到了一点有用的信息：外星俘虏已经确认，入侵地球的目的就是为了一个一个地杀人，而不是一下子灭绝全人类。似乎他们并不是真正想要消灭我们。&#10;&#10;事实上，这并不是什么未知的秘密。如果外星人想要消灭我们，他们可以从近地轨道上把我们直接炸成渣。很显然，外星人的入侵行为具有某种更高级的目的，但是我们并不能够从目前的外星俘虏口中获得。我们需要捕获一位外星首领来获得更多信息。</cdesc>
