<desc>The Hyperion is a powerful hovertank designed to support Xenonaut strike teams in combat zones. It employs alien antigravity technology to skim roughly a metre above the ground at all times, ignoring normally impassable terrain (such as water). &#10;&#10;The Hyperion has significantly better combat performance than the Scimitar tank it replaces. It has greater mobility and can move much faster than its predecessor, but uses hardened alloys to derive increased protection from thinner armour plating. It is inherently more stable as a gun platform than a tracked / wheeled vehicle and has also been fitted with upgraded targeting computers, giving it excellent accuracy at all ranges. Though barely half the size of a modern battle tank, one of these skimmers could easily defeat an entire armoured platoon single-handedly.&#10;&#10;The skimming effect is provided by the anti-gravity generator, which reduces the effective weight of the tank to a couple of hundred kilos when active (without it, the Hyperion is a six-ton lump of immobile metal). Vectored thrust is then provided by a small jet turbine, producing the skim effect and allowing the precision maneuvers required to operate the vehicle in confined spaces. The integrated AR-6 reactor requires a large amount of Alenium to construct, but will provide enough power to maintain the anti-gravity field for at least a year. That should be more than enough time to settle this war, one way or another.</desc>
<cdesc>亥伯龙气垫坦克用于在作战趋于为战士提供支援。它采用外星的无重力技术，悬浮于地面上一米的空中，在某些地形中无法通行（例如水面）。&#10;&#10;亥伯龙强大的作战能力可以取代弯刀坦克。它可以比上一代移动地更加迅速，使用了坚硬的合金在保证敏捷性的同时也不减护甲强度。从本质上说它更像一个机枪台，而不是战车戴具。它配备了高级的目标锁定计算机，能在各种距离下提供高精准度射击。虽然它们的体积只有现代作战坦克的一半，但是任何一个气垫坦克用一只手就能击败一个装甲排。&#10;&#10;悬浮效果是由一个反重力装置支持的，它工作时减轻了坦克几百公斤的重量，没有它，亥伯龙只是六吨没用的金属。小型喷射式涡轮提供了矢量推进，使坦克可以悬浮在空中，还可以在有限的空间内进行精密的驾驶。完整的 AR-6反应堆需要大量的 Alenium 来建造，但是可以给反重力场提供一年的动力，无论如何，都足够我们解决这场战争了。</cdesc>
