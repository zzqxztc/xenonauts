<desc>My team have finished work on the VH-2 Scimitar, a remotely-piloted battlefield vehicle designed to provide close support to our strike teams. It is slower than the Hunter scout car, but is a much more capable combatant. It is considerably tougher than its predecessor and is armed with a powerful integrated Pulse Laser (which can be upgraded in future if we develop better weapons).&#10;&#10;The chassis of the Scimitar is squat but sturdy, giving the vehicle a low profile and providing ample space for the vehicle's powerplant - the ER-4 Alenium Impulsion reactor, a downscaled version of the Corsair's ER-3 reactor. The turret weapon draws power directly from the reactor, eliminating the need for any ammunition storage areas in the turret. Instead, this space houses a complex array of cameras / sensors. Semi-intelligent alien electronics inside the vehicle handle many of the simpler tasks usually performed by the driver, allowing us to situate the vehicle pilot safely within a control facility back at base. I personally fitted signal boosters to our dropships that allow a driver to control the vehicle as if he were inside it, despite potentially being thousands of miles away. Unsurprisingly, our tests so far suggest I have done an excellent job setting everything up. &#10;&#10;Removal of the driver has two chief advantages - the first is that the removal of the crew compartment and the ventilation systems leaves space for additional armour, naturally itself also constructed from alien materials. Given that vehicles are large targets on the battlefield, this added durability is extremely valuable. Secondly, the fact that one of your units is a lump of inert metal (albeit an expensive one) rather than a living and breathing human being may make battlefield decisions a little easier for you.</desc>
<cdesc>我们团队设计出了 VH-2 型弯刀，这种装甲车可以远程操控，近距离支援我们的攻击小分队。它的速度比猎手侦查车慢，但是战斗力更强。它比上一代更加强悍，并且装备了综合脉冲激光器（可以升级成更先进的武器）。&#10;&#10;弯刀的底盘低但是坚硬无比，保证了战车的外形低矮，又为发动机提供了充足的空间——ER-4 脉冲反应堆，海盗船 ER-3 反应堆的简化版。炮塔武器可以从反应堆中直接吸收能量，从而不需要任何弹药存储空间。省下的这部分空间装备了一组复杂的摄像机和传感器，配合外星电子设置，使得战车可以处理一些原本该由司机处理的简单情况。在这些精密设备的辅助下，驾驶员可以坐在基地的控制设备中安全地驾驶装甲车。配合运输机内的信号增强装置，驾驶员可以对千里之外的战车操控自如。当然了，我们已经做了一系列测试，来确保所有的部件都能正常工作。&#10;&#10;远程控制给战车提供了两个主要优点：第一，战车里面不需要战士操作，就省下了一大部分生活空间和通风设备空间，可以装备额外的装甲，当然，也是用外星材料做的。鉴于装甲车在战场上是大型的目标，这点额外的耐久可谓无价之宝。第二，由于这些部队是没有生命的金属（虽然很昂贵）而不是活生生的战士，在战场上做出决定就简单地多了。</cdesc>
